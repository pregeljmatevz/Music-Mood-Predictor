## Introduction

The Music Mood Predictor is a Flask web application that utilizes K-means clustering to determine the mood or emotion associated with a song. It merges song data (`songs.csv`) and mood data (`mood.csv`), computes centroids for each emotion, and allows users to select a song from a list to predict its mood.

## Features

- Predicts the mood of a song based on its audio features.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface to interact with the prediction system.
- Allows users to select songs dynamically loaded from `songs.csv`.

## Installation

To run the Music Mood Predictor locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-mood-predictor.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd music-mood-predictor
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory and follow the installation steps above.
3. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the Music Mood Predictor.
